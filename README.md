# BabelTranspiler

Babel is the most popular transpiler/compiler for converting ES6 to ES5 code. You are probbaly using it without knowing you are using it!

This application is just for fun and practice.

As it is safer to convert ES6 code to ES5 code for the browsers to render correctly, we need babel and also polyfills.
